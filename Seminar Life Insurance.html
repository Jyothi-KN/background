    <h1>How Does Life Insurance Work?</h1>        
    <p>Term life insurance is coverage that lasts for a period of time chosen at purchase. This type of life insurance commonly covers 10-, 20- or even 30-year periods. If you die during the covered period, the policy will pay your beneficiaries the amount stated in the policy. If you don’t die during that time, no one gets paid.
<br>
        Term life is popular because it offers large payouts at a lower cost than permanent life. It’s also a temporary solution. It exists for the same reason temporary tattoos and hair dyes do — sometimes a little while is long enough.</p>  

        <p>Reasons you may want term life insurance include:
<br>
           1. You want to make sure your child has money to go to college, even if you die.
            <br>
          2. You have a mortgage that you don’t want to saddle your spouse with after your death.
           <br> 
          3.  You can’t afford the higher premiums of permanent life insurance and still want coverage.</p>

         <br>
         <p>

           Undoubtedly, it is a necessity for a breadwinner to safeguard their dependents in case of their unfortunate and untimely demise, accident or physical disabilities that lead to a loss of income.
            Having said that, there is a long list of other benefits that make it a must-have. Sadly, most people are not aware of the many benefits offered by a life plan. 
          All they care about are the death and disability benefits. However, there are plenty of other benefits offered by life policies such as maturity benefits, tax benefits etc.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>Let's take a look at the benifits:</p>
        
         <h1>1. Acts as loan Collateral</h1>
         <p>
          In lending agreements, collateral is a borrower's pledge of specific property to a lender, to secure repayment of a loan. The collateral serves as a lender's protection against a borrower's default and so can be used to offset the loan if the borrower fails to pay the principal and interest satisfactorily under the terms of the lending agreement.
         </p>
      
         <h1>2. Online payment Discount</h1>

         <h1>3. Discount As Per The Opted payment Periodicity</h1>
         <p>
         A discount period is the amount of time a cash discount is available for a customer to make a reduced cash payment. In other words, this is the time period that a vendor is willing to reduce the price of a product if the customer will pay for it in cash.
         </p>
         <h1>4. Taking Care Of Buisness</h1>
         <p>Business lending offers great opportunities for credit unions, but the inherent inefficiencies in loan processes, from manual paper processing to redundant data entry, typically translate into frustration for both the business member and the lender. 
           If credit unions can find a way to incorporate automation to streamline this previously burdensome process, 
           they can differentiate themselves by saving time, reducing costs and boosting the overall member experience.</p>
           <h1>5. Tax Benefits</h1>
           <p>The term tax benefit refers to a tax law that helps taxpayers reduce their tax liabilities. Tax benefits are often created as a type of incentive for promoting responsible behaviors or commercial activities.
